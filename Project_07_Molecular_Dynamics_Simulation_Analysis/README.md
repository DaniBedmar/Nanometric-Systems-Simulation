# Project 07

In this project, we performed a simple molecular dynamics simulation using [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/). NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems.

These simulations were performed with NAMD, visualized and analyzed with [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) and Python. The objective was to study the effect of temperature change on a nanoparticle in the void, as described in [HomeWork.pdf](HomeWork.pdf).
