# Project 06

In this project, our objective was to reproduce the results of a [paper published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05180). In this paper, the authors perform DFT simulations to analyze the magnetic states that appear at the edges of zig-zag configuration of graphene (ZGNR).

As you will see in the [report](Report9_SSN_Bedmar_Daniel.pdf), we divided this project into different objectives in order to break down this complex task and be able to achieve it without being overwhelmed by it.
