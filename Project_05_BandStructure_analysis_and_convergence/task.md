1. Perform an analysis of how the total energy of graphene evolves with the number of K points. Increase the K points one by one up to 9, and then by 3 until you deem it necessary. Create plots showing the evolution of the total energy and optionally the time taken for the simulation (this is printed as "Elapsed wall time" near the end of the SIESTA output). Determine reasonably with which parameters the results can be considered converged. If you notice any other trends that may be interesting to comment on, please do so. Since the two lattice vectors of graphene are "equivalent," you can increase the K points in both x and y simultaneously. For example, perform a calculation with "1x1x1", one with "2x2x1", one with "3x3x1", etc.

2. Use the same structure as for graphene, but replace the atoms with B and N to simulate hBN. Explore the bands, fatbands, and/or projected state densities. Comment (backed up by figures from the plots you have made) on the differences between this material and graphene, as well as anything else interesting about how the states are distributed in this material. To simulate this new material, you will need pseudopotentials for the species you are introducing. Get them from here: periodictable-gga-abinit (ONLY FOR PRACTICE! Do not use them for serious calculations).
