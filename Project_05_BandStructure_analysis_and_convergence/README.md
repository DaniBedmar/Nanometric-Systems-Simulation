# Project 05

In this project, we were working with [SIESTA](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/About/overview.html), a method for performing efficient electronic structure calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

The task, which can be found in [task.md](task.md), aimed to perform energy convergence calculations of graphene and hBN, followed by an analysis of the resulting electronic structure, in order to test the abilities acquired in previous classes.

#### Files in the repository

- [Report_05_Bedmar_Daniel.htmll](Report_05_Bedmar_Daniel.html): The report for this project was created using a Jupyter Notebook. This format allows the reader to follow the report alongside the simulations to understand the process clearly. Therefore, by reading the HTML file, the report can be accessed without executing the cells of the notebook.

- [task.md](task.md): File containing the proposed task.

- [Files.zip](Files.zip): Compressed folder containing the Jupyter notebook and all the necessary and generated files during the simulations.
