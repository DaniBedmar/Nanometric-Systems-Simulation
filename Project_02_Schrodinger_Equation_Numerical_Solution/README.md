# Project 02

In this project, we had to choose a problem that involved the numerical solution of Schrodinger's Equation (could be one which we had seen in other classes or one presented in [Chem LibreTexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Quantum_Tutorials_(Rioux)/09%3A_Numerical_Solutions_for_Schrodinger's_Equation)), then solve it and see if the answer made sense with the theory.
