# Nanometric Systems Simulation

In this repository, you will find projects I did for "Nanometric Systems Simulation," a university subject taught by Professor Jordi Faraudo.

During this subject, we learned different methods used in today's computational-theoretical research groups. As stated in the Quick-Off meeting presentation, in this course, we did the following things:

- Using code (mainly Python) to make scientific calculations
- Working with existing scientific simulation software ([VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), [SIESTA](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/About/overview.html), and others)
- Designing and running simulations (mainly molecular dynamics and DFT simulations)
- Using online data (for example, protein data bank, crystallographic databases) to design simulations
- Analyzing results with analysis software or ad-hoc scripts
- Making images and movies to communicate results
