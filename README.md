# Nanometric-Systems-Simulation
In this repository you will find projects I did for "Nanometric Systems Simulation" a uni subject taught by professor Jordi Faraudo.

During this subject we learned different methods used in nowadays computational-theorical research groups and, as stands in the Quick-Off meeting presentation, in this course
we did the following things:

- Using code (mainly Python) to make scientific calculations
- Working with existing scientific simulation software ([VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/),[NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/),[SIESTA](https://siesta-project.org/siesta/About/overview.html) and others)
- Designing and running simulations (mainly molecular dynamics and DFT simulations)
- Use online data (for example protein data bank,
crystallographic databases) to design simulations
- Analyzing results with analysis software or ad-hoc scripts
- Making images and movies to communicate results
