# Project 07
In this project we performed a simple molecular dynamics simulation using [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/).
NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems.

This simulations were performed with NAMD, visualized and analyzed with [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) 
and python. And had the objective of studying the effect of the temperature change in a nanoparticle in the void, as can be read 
in [HomeWork.pdf](HomeWork.pdf).
