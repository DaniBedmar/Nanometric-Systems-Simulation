# Final project: Water Transport through Carbon Nanotubes

In this repository, you will find the final project I did. This project consisted of studying how water flows through carbon nanotubes changes depending on an applied pressure.

The simulations were done using [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), as its molecular dynamics methods are excellent for studying reasonably large systems and obtaining good precision while avoiding excessive computational costs. The modeling of the studied structure and the visualization of the simulations were done with [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). The analysis was done with a TCL console that comes integrated with VMD, and the plots were done with Python.
