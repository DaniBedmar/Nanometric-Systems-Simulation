# Project 01

In this first project, we had to choose one of the Python scripts shown in class and modify it. The Python scripts performed simple mathematical calculations. All of them are available at: [Python Examples Repository](https://github.com/jfaraudo/Python_examples)

I chose the "parabolic_motion.py" script, in which the user can enter the launch angle of a parabolic projectile motion and its trajectory gets plotted. I modified it so the user could also choose the initial velocity and a certain time at which an explosion happened (the physics behind are described in the report), and then the script would plot the trajectory but also showing how the trajectory if the explosion never happened would've been.
