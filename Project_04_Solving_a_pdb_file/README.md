# Project 04

In the classes prior to this project, we were introduced to Molecular Dynamics and to the software [Visual Molecular Dynamics](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (VMD), a tool for visualizing and analyzing large biomolecular systems and molecular dynamics simulations.

Therefore, we were tasked with choosing between modifying a code that integrated Newton's laws or attempting to solve a [pdb problema](https://github.com/DaniBedmar/Nanometric-Systems-Simulation/blob/main/Project_04_Solving_a_pdb_file/pdb_files/problema.pdb) file with VMD but without any information. I chose the latter option.

#### Notes
Completing this project was one of the most satisfying experiences (from a scientific perspective) I had during my entire degree. I was required to follow a deduction system using knowledge from different subjects I studied during my degree while learning to use this new software. Although I wasn't able to correctly identify one of the structures (it was the "remdesivir" drug, which inhibits RNA replication), I was able to correctly identify the complex and the biological process it represented.

The actual correction given by Professor Jordi faraudo was: "Effectively, it is a trimeric protein doing something with a nucleic acid (in this case, RNA). The molecule you have identified that is neither nucleic acid nor protein is the drug remdesivir. In fact, it is the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex of SARS-CoV-2 with RNA and the drug remdesivir that blocks viral RNA replication."

As you can see, the report is presented as a PowerPoint. This decision was made in order to present the deduction process in a more linear manner.
