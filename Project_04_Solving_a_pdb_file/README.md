# Project 04
In the classes previous of this project we were introduced to Molecular Dynamics and 
to the software Visual Molecular Dynamics [https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/](VMD), 
a software to visualize and analyze large biomoelcular systems and molecular dynamics simulations.

Therefore, we were tasked to chose between modifying a code that integrated Newton's laws or
trying to solve a [problema pdb](https://github.com/DaniBedmar/Nanometric-Systems-Simulation/blob/main/Project_04_Solving_a_pdb_file/pdb_files/problema.pdb) file with VMD  but without any information. I chose this last option.


#### Notes
Doing this project was one of the most satisfactory (in a scientific way) I did in all my degree, 
as I was forced to follow a deduction system using knowledge from different subjects I coursed while
studying my degree as I learned to use this new software and, altough I wasn't able to identify one
of the structures correctly (it was the "remdesivir" drug which inhibits the RNA replication) I was
able to correctly identify the complex and what biological porocess was being representated.

As you can see, the report is presented as a power point, this was a decision I took in order to show
the deduction process followed in a more linear way.
